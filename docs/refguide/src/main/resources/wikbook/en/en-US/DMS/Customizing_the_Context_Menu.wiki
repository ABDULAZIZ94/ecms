h1. Customizing the Context Menu




When using the file explorer you can *customize* the right click context menu by *adding actions* to it.


First learn how to assign an action to a folder: [ECM:Managing Actions]

When assigning a new action to a node:
* Select the "SendMail" action in the action list (This is only an example! You can create a [custom action|ECM:User-Defined+Action+Types] and assign it here.)

* Enter the name "SendToArchive".
* Choose the lifecylce "*user action*". This lifecylce add the action to the *right-click context menu*.

* Finally, save the action.


On the *left pane* click the right mouse button on the node you have just assigned the action to.

There you will find the name "SendToArchive" in the *right click menu*.
