h1. Bonita Resource bundle



h1. Overview


You can associate an activity to a resource-bundle and customize the form display. You have to define a file .properties for each activity requiring a form.

h1. Configuration

For example, in forms.xml the tag:

{code}
<resource-bundle>evaluation</resource-bundle>
{code}

refers to a file named "evaluation.properties" in src/conf directory.

 * evaluation.properties file:

{code}
task-name=Evaluate holidays
title=Evaluate holidays

submit=Submit

#variable title and label
initiator.label=Initiator :
start.label=Start (dd/mm/yyyy) :
end.label=End (dd/mm/yyyy) :

Approve.submit=Approve
Approve.value=Approve
Disapprove.submit=Disapprove
Disapprove.value=Disapprove
Refuse.submit=Refuse
Refuse.value=Refuse
{code}


As we have seen, the value of the attribute can be set by the user in the Form or set programmatically by a hook.
