h1. Folksonomy Concept

h2. Overview





# folksonomy is a user-generated taxonomy used to categorize and retrieve web content such as Web pages, photographs and Web links, using open-ended labels called tags. Typically, folksonomies are Internet-based, however, their use may occur in other contexts. The folksonomic tagging is intended to make a body of information easily to search, discover, and navigate over time. A well-developed folksonomy is ideally accessible as a shared vocabulary that is both originated by and familiar to its primary users. Two widely cited examples of websites using folksonomic tagging are Flickr and [del.icio.us|http://del.icio.us], although it has been suggested that [Flickr|http://www.flickr.com] is not a good example of folksonomy. <br>
