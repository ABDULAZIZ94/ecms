h1. Taxonomy Concept



Taxonomies are used to sort documents in order to ease searches when browsing documents online. The main idea behind that concept is to provide a multi dimensional set of paths to find a document. The best example is when you browse Yahoo news. In many cases, you can get your content by using different category paths. Therefore, after creating a document somewhere in the repository, it is possible to categorize it by adding several taxonomy references. By browsing the taxonomy tree, it will be possible to find the referencing article and display them as if they were children of the taxonomy nodes. As you can imagine, taxonomies are stored in the JCR itself and we are using the JCR Reference functionality to provide that advanced ECM feature.

Managing the tree of taxonomies is very simple, you can copy/cut nodes and paste them. Of course you can add and remove taxonomies from the tree. Once a taxonomy has been added, any user who has access to the "Manage Categories" icon from his/her view can then browse the taxonomy tree and refer one of its nodes from the created documents.
