h1. WebDav Access



Since version 2.2, ECM changed the behavior to access WebDAV server.

We split to two ways:

Public mode:

[http//host:port-rest-jcr-]\{repositoryName}/\{workspaceName}/\{nodePath}

Private mode:

[http//host:port-rest-private-jcr-]\{repositoryName}/\{workspaceName}/\{nodePath}

The difference between Public mode and Private mode is: When accessing the WebDAV server, if the URL is Private mode, WebDAV will ask users to enter username and password. And if the URL is Public mode, there is no need to enter username and password, of course see only the public nodes shared with everyone.

You can see changes in the web.xml file at the location exo.ecm.web.ecmportal/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/

Change param-value for this filter
{code:xml}
  <filter>
    <filter-name>AnonymousUserContextRedirectionFilter</filter-name>
    <filter-class>org.exoplatform.ws.frameworks.servlet.AnonymousUserContextRedirectionFilter</filter-class>
		<init-param>
      <param-name>context-name</param-name>
      <param-value>/rest/private</param-value>
    </init-param>
  </filter>
{code}

and filter mapping also

{code:xml}
  <filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>RestEncodingFilter</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/rest/*</url-pattern>
  </filter-mapping>

  <filter-mapping>
  <!-- This must be before ThreadLocalSessionProviderInitializedFilter for URI /rest/private/* -->
    <filter-name>AnonymousUserContextRedirectionFilter</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/rest/private/*</url-pattern>
  </filter-mapping>

  <filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>ThreadLocalSessionProviderInitializedFilter</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/rest/private/*</url-pattern>
  </filter-mapping>
{code}

But note that, the difference is the URL
