h1. Autoversioning Action in DMS


When the *Autoversioning* action is assigned to a folder, it will automatically create new versions for the folder and its childnodes without the need to check-out/check-in. For check-in and check-out refer to [ECM:Version+Control+and+Locking#AddVersionsforNodes].

The *autoversioning* action is applied to the folder or its child nodes depending on selecting the lifecyle:

- If the lifecycle is *User Action*: The action is applied to the current folder.

- If the lifecycle is *Add*/ *remove*/ *modify*/ *schedule*: The action is applied to the child nodes of the folder.


|| Lifecycle|| Meaning ||
| Add| The action will be executed to a new document, but not to a subfolder when the document or the subfolder is created in the folder in which an action has been added to. It's also applied to a new document in the subfolder of the folder. |
| User Action | The action is executed when right-clicking on the folder and then select the action. |
| Modify| The action will be executed when a folder /node is modified.  |
| Remove| The action will be executed to a document, but not to a subfolder in the folder when the document or the subfolder is moved. |
| Schedule |The action is done at specific time. There are 2 schedule lifecyle types: period and cron.(See more [Schedule lifecycle]). |
