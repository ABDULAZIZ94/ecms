The node type template is used to edit and display the node content.
Each node type has one _dialog1.gtmpl_ file (dialog template) for editing/creating a node and one _view1.gtmpl_ file (view template) for viewing the node content.
Using the dialog template, you can specify a dialog whose fields correspond to the properties of the node you want to edit their values. When this template is rendered,
each specified field will appear with a data input box for you to edit. Note that you do not have to
design a dialog in which all data of the node are listed to be edited. You can just list the subset of node data you want to edit.
Like the dialog template, the view template renders information of the node. You just need to create the template and specify which data fields to be displayed.
With this kind of template, node information is only displayed but can not be edited.
