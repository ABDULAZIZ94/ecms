h1.  Drives Concept



h1. Overview

In eXo ECM it is possible to let the ECM administrator dynamically create drives on the top of JCR Workspaces.

Actually, a drive is a customized workspace with:

    * a configured path where a user will start when browsing the drive
    * a set of allowed views that will allow limiting the available actions (such as the edition or creation of contents while being in the drive)
    * a set of permissions allows limiting the access (and view) of the drive to a limited number of people
    * a set of options to describe the behavior of the drive when an user browses it (when we show the file explorer on the left, what types of folder we should add to the drive...)

Hence a workspace can have several drives configured on its top. The ECM administrator can create and edit new drives from the ECM admin portlet which contains a "Manage Drive" action. Drives, like Workspaces are bound to a JCR Repository.

It is possible to add a new drive including one display on the taxonomy tree. Once a new drive is added, we can directly see it inside the File Explorer portlet and inside the correct Repository.





h1. Drives in DMS

eXo DMS facilitates many drive types that help you organize, manage and search for folders, documents quickly and effectively. These few representative drives below will partly help you to clearly and fast acquire more about drives in eXo DMS.
