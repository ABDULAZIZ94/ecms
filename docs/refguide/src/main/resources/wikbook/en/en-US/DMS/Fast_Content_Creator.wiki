h1. Fast Content Creator




In File Explorer when you create a document, you need to:
 - Firstly, access to the location that you want to save.
 - Then select a template that you want to create.

Thus *Fast Content Creator* is used to support for this purpose. *Fast Content Creator* is used to support users to create and save a new document in a special location without going into the File Explorer. <br> <br>
