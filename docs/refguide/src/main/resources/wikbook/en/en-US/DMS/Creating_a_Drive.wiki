h1. Creating a Drive

# drive can be understood as a data storage device that is used to store folders with many documents in it. In a drive, folders are organized in a tree structure with sub-nodes that are other folders or documents. In addition to, you also may perform many supported actions on each object type.
On the other hand, a drive is a customized workspace that consists of:
* A configured path from where the user will start when browsing the drive.
* A set of allowed views that for example will allow to limit the available actions (such as the edition or creation of contents while being in the drive)
* A set of permissions to limit the access (and view) of the drive to a limited number of people.
* A set of options to describe the behavior of the drive when a user will browse it (will we show the file explorer on the left, what type of folder we should add to the drive...)
