- Search on this location is the path that you selected to search from
- Input exactly the name of node that you want to search.
- Click the *Search* button. It will return "No result found" if there is no node with searching name. If the searching name has been existing, the result will be return in the *Search Result* tab like the simple search.


h2. Searching with Constraints


This kind of search allows you to search with more constraints to limit the returned results.

*Current location* is the path that you selected to search from.

By this way, you can do like simple search by inputting the search term into A word or phrase in the content field and then click Search. The result will be returned in the *Search Results* tab.

Or you can search with more constraints:

1\. Input the search term that you want to search in the content fields of nodes.

2. Select the *Operator*

- Select AND when you want to combine the inputed string and the constraints will be added after selecting an operator. The search result will not be blank only when there's a node can be reached both two conditions (the phrase and the constraints).
- Select OR when you want to combine the inputed string and the constraints will be added after selecting an operator. The search result will not be blank when there's a node can be reached at least one of two conditions (the phrase and the constraints).

3. Click the *Show/hide constraints form* button to add more constraints. The adding constraints form appears:

|| Field  || Meaning ||
| Operator  | You can add more than one constraint thus there are two operators AND and OR for you to combine. |
| The second row  |  allows you to add a constraint to search by a property with exactly specific value. |
| The third row  |  allows you to add a constraint to search by a property that contains one of the word in the specific string. |
| The fourth row   |  allows you to add a constraint to search by a property that does not contain the specific string. |
| The fifth row  | allows you to add a constraint to search by a duration of date (created, modified). |
| The sixth row  | allows you to add a constraint to search by the document type (File, Article, Podcast, Sample node, File Plan, Kofax) |
| The seventh row  | allows you to add a constraint to search by categories. |
