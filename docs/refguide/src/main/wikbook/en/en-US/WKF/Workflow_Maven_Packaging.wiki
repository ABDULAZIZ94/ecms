h1. Workflow Maven Packaging


The obtained tree needs to be similar to the one provided in this holiday-standalone.zip archive.

To generate the package to be deployed, simply go the root project
  (where you placed pom.xml file) and type:
{code}
  mvn package
{code}

You'll find the jar package in "target" directory. Refer to the Workflow portlet documentation to see how to upload and manage your workflow in eXo.

#info("you may see some business processes with a \".bpar\" extension. The extension does not matter because the package is in a zip file format.")
