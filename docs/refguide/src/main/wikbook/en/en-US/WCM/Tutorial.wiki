\1. [Install Java SE 5.0|http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp] (Java Runtime)

Based on JavaEE, our WCM runs currently fine with *version 1.5* so if you are using JavaEE with newer version, please download and install this version of WCM to make WCM works fine. We will support newer version of Java very soon.
