h1. WebDAV in WCM


WCM supports two ways to use WebDAV in sites management:


+_*The 1st way*_:+ 

This way is used when you are on a Window System and your computer has to be connected to the Internet or Intranet.

1\. Go into the *My Network Places* folder on your local computer. You will see all shared files and folders:

- Enter or copy a link to view a site by WebDAV in a browser into the *Internet or network address* field. For an example, the link to view 'acme' site by WebDAV is: http://localhost:8080/portal/rest/private/jcr/repository/collaboration/sitescontent/live/acme

- Click the *Next* button and wait for few minutes to take affect. A folder named 'acme on localhost' is corresponding to the inputted link will appear in the *My Network Places* folder:
