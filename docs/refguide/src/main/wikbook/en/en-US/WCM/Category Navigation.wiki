h2. Overview


WCM 1.2 provides users with Category Navigation Portlet and Parameterized Content List Viewer portlet in order to get rid of long URLs and help users see published documents or webcontents in specific categories in one page.

As you know, when you view documents or webcontents by CLV(Content List Viewer), its URLs is too long and complex:

_*Notice*_: Users can see the URL in the address bar or on the status bar when moving the mouse over content titles in the CLV. In these screenshots, the URL is on the status bar.

Thanks to the appearance of Category Navigation Portlet and Parameterized Content List Viewer, users are provided with many benefits, they easily view documents or webcontents in specific categories with shorter and friendly URL:

If someone interested in this new improvement in details, please refer [Content Friendly URL] 



The category navigation is not so different than the navigation we're using in WCM 1.1. As before, we use the PCV to show a content in a page based on the URL context. More than that, we also use contextual URL to show a list of contents inside a CLV. 

The *News* page that users go to through the Navigation bar is an easy- understandable application of Category Navigation portlet and Parameterized Content List Viewer portlet.

1\. Go to *News* on the navigation bar.
