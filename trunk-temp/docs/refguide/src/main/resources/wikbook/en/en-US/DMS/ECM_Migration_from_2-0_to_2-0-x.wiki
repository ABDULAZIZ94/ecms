h1. ECM Migration from 2-0 to 2-0-x

Since ECM 2.0.x, we added property *exo:accessPermission* to drive and view node.  So we provided the migration service called PropertiesMigrationService at the location _ecm/branches/2.0.x/component/migration/2.0.x/properties_. This service is used to add property *exo:accessPermission* to drive node and view node which didn't contain this property in ECM 2.0. <br>

   How to migrate it ? Follow these steps :

   Step 1: Compile the source code to create new jar *(exo.ecm.component.migration.2.0.x.properties-2.0.x.jar)* by command:
{code:xml}
mvn clean install
{code}

   Step 2: Stop server and copy this jar to library.<br>

   Step 3: Run server to DriveMigrationService apply the changes.<br>

   Step 4: After server has started, stop server again and remove this jar, restart server.
