*Overview*

The templates are applied to a NodeType or a metadata MixinType. Two kinds of templates exist :

* *dialogs* : are html forms that allow to create node instances.
* *views* : are html fragments used to display nodes.

From the ECM admin portlet, _Manage Template_ lists existing NodeTypes that have been associated to Dialog and/or View templates. These templates can be attached to permissions (in the usual _membership:group_ form), so that a specific one is displayed according to the rights of the user (very useful in a content validation workflow activity).

*DocumentType*

# checkbox allows to say if the NodeType should be considered as a *DocumentType*. File Explorer considers such nodes as user content and applies the following behavior :

* View template will be used to display the DocumentType nodes
* DocumentTypes nodes can created by the '_Add Document_' action
* non DocumentType are hidden (unless _'Show non document types'_ option is checked)

Templates are written using [Groovy Templates|http://groovy.codehaus.org/Groovy+Templates] and will require some experience with JCR API and HTML notions.
