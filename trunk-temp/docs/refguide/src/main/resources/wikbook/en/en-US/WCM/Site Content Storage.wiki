h1. Site Content Storage Concept


In eXo WCM, *Website content storage* or *site content storage* is the terminology referring to all information that is stored in a site, including:
* *webcontent* is for all information blocks in that site
* *documents,media(image,sound, video), link, code or markup* that are shared for all webpages
* *Site artifacts* like _banner, footer, navigation, breadcrumbs_

eXo WCM organizes site content in hierarchical structure that consists of:

* A *js folder*: is to store all shared javascripts for a website
* A *css folder*: is to store all shared css for a website
* A *document folder:* is to store all shared documents for all webpages
* A *media folder*: is to store all shared media content types (images, sounds, video) for a website
* A *link folder:* is to store all shared links that a webcontent can be referred to.
* A *webcontent folder:* is to store all webcontents that are used in the webpages or nodes.
* A *site artifacts folder*: is to store all site artifacts like banner, footer.. as webcontent. This folder is a child of *webcontent folder*

h2. One place is to manage all site content storages
Each site content is managed in a site content storage, it means that content of all sites will be managed in one place, each site content is a folder of the site content storage.

h2. Shared site content folder
This is a special place that has same structure with other site content storages but doesn't map to any real site. The purpose of this storage is to share all site resources (document, link, css, js...) with all sites in the eXo WCM system.


h2. Access to site content storage
eXo WCM has some ways to access site content storage:

- [By WebDav|JCR:WebDav]
