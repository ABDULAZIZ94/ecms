h1. JCR Hierarchy



The Java Content Repository Specification introduces several levels of granularity to store contents. Most of them are optional but once again eXo implements them all.

As you can see on the next schema, the entry point is a Repository object that contains several Workspaces. Each workspace is bound to be a tree of Nodes and Property objects. The leaves of the nodes are the ECM documents, structured (article, events..) or unstructured ones (PDF, Word, Images...).

As an analogy with File System in usual Operating Systems, we can compare the Workspaces with File Partitions.

In eXo JCR, Repositories and workspaces can be [dynamically managed|JCR:Repository  and Workspace management] in an unique way.
