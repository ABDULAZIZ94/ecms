h1. JCR Namespaces

h1. Overview



The JCR specification introduces the Namespace concept (taken from the similar XML concept) that allows people to register their own set of nodetypes and to be sure that those could be imported in several repositories without any conflicts.

Hence we highly advise you to create a new namespace for your company/organization as soon as you wish to create a new content structure which means new NodeType and associated dialog and view templates.

Adding a new namespace through the ECM admin user interface is very simple. First, you will be able to reach the namespace list which by default contains only a system namespace imported at the very first time the Platform is launched. Then, to add namespace you simply need to provide an alias and a mapped URI. Note that for the XML namespace, the URI does not need to be a real location, it must just be unique.

Now, every time you try to add a new NodeType you will be able to select your namespace from a selected list.

When a part of the JCR tree is exported as XML content, Namespaces will be used as XML ones.
