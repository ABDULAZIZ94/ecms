h1. Edit Mode Switch

In WCM version 1.0, we can see a lot of functions, which support for webmasters to control their web sites. And now in WCM version 1.1, we continues to update some feature as ON or OFF edit mode. With this function, Administrator can quickly display the edit icon or hide all of them.

  The first time, when the administrator log in, it will display the main page of WCM but it will hide (the *OFF* edit mode) quick edit icon in some function as edit banner, edit home page, or edit single content viewer. We can see below:

when click the *OFF* mode, we can not see any quick edit icon on the interface.

 If the administrator want to edit all of them, he/she can do this easily by clicking *ON* to quickly show the edit icon:

Now we can see all quick edit that are displayed on the interface. This function is really flexible for webmasters.

By default, the status of the edit mode is 'off'. It means that you only view the current site without editing site's layout component and you will see the current status with 'O' character at the upper right corner:

Thus, to switch between statuses, just click on the character of the current status of the edit mode.
